# Token-Backed Study Group Smart Contract

## Description

The Token-Backed Study Group is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that creates a token-incentivized learning environment. This innovative platform allows users to form study groups where members contribute tokens as an entry fee to join, creating a shared reward pool that encourages active participation and commitment to learning goals.

The smart contract features two core functions:
- **Group Creation**: Educators or group leaders can establish new study groups with customizable entry fees
- **Member Enrollment**: Learners can join study groups by contributing the required tokens, which are pooled together for future rewards

By requiring a financial commitment through token contribution, the platform ensures that members are genuinely invested in their learning journey while building a sustainable ecosystem for educational collaboration.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize online education by creating a decentralized, token-incentivized learning ecosystem where:

- **Financial commitment drives engagement**: By requiring token contributions, we ensure serious participation and reduce dropout rates
- **Peer-to-peer learning is rewarded**: Active contributors and high-performing members can be rewarded from the shared token pool
- **Educational accessibility is enhanced**: Lower barriers to entry for quality education through blockchain technology
- **Learning communities are self-sustaining**: Token economics create sustainable funding models for educational content and group activities
- **Trust and transparency are paramount**: Blockchain technology ensures fair distribution of rewards and transparent fund management
